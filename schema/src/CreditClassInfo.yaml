  CreditClassInfo:
    description: Base class with common fields used to define credit class info.
    slots:
      - name
      - description
      - url
    slot_usage:
      name:
        required: true
    attributes:
      hasPrimaryImpact:
        description: The primary impact expected from adhering to the protocol and/or management practices associated with the credit class. Generally speaking the quantifiable components of this impact are associated with the credit type that the credit class exists under (e.g. Carbon, Biodiversity, etc).
        range: Impact
        required: true
      hasCoBenefits:
        description: Co-benefits are any secondary impacts that may result from adhering to the protocol and/or management practices associated with the credit class. They can be qualitative or quantitative.
        range: Impact
        multivalued: true
      hasSourceRegistry:
        description: The registry where the credits are originally issued and tracked if somewhere other than Regen Network.
        range: Registry
      managedUnderProgram:
        description: The higher-level rules and requirements under which the given credit protocol operates, sometimes referred to as the "Standard".
        range: CreditingProgram
      creditProtocol:
        description: The root document of the credit protocol that defines the requirements and process to register and issue credits under a credit protocol. It could be registered under a program or independent. It could include methods to measure and monitor, or reference other methodology documents.
        range: CreditProtocol
      hasApprovedMethodologies:
        description: If one or more standalone methodologies for quantifying GHG or other benefits are approved for use, supplemental to any explicit methodlogies defined within the main creditProtocol document, they can be listed here.
        range: Methodology
        multivalued: true
      hasCreditingTerm:
        description: The total duration of the crediting term for the project.
        range: duration
      eligibleEnvironmentTypes:
        description: Types of environments that a project registered under this credit class may focuses on.
        range: EnvironmentTypeTypes
        multivalued: true
      eligibleActivities:
        description: Eligible activities for projects registered under this credit class.
        range: ActivityTypes
        multivalued: true
    todos:
      - remove unused prefixes
      - make sure imports explicitly written in each schema file
      - remove BT01 Credit Class from sidebar, and update sidebar folder structure
      - is "hasSDG" the appropriate name for the attribute in the Impact class?
      - how do we reconcile "Impact" class with the taxonomic enum?
      - cleanup usage of "EnvironmentTypeTypes" and "ActivityTypes" in the schema. Types should be singular, and we should align on either using Type suffix in enums or not.
