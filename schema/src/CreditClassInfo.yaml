    todos:
      - What's the relationship between creditProtocol and approvedMethodologies, in terms of which is required and not? Should one be folded into the other, or atleast align on a single class for the fields' ranges?
      - what's hte relationship between sourceRegistry and program?
      - Should creditProtocol have a field for "program" instead of program living in the CreditClassInfo?
      - are the correct slots required?
      - is the inheritiance setup with Biodiv & Carbon correct?
      - clarificaiton on naming for primaryImpact & coBenefits?
      - should fields in general be switched to snake_case, and use verbs like has_, is_, or part_of_? (https://linkml.io/linkml/schemas/linter.html#standard-naming)
