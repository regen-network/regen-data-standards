name: Yahara WINS Watershed Carbon Project
description: The Yahara WINS Watershed Carbon Project implements nature-based and green infrastructure
  practices that avoid emissions from construction and operation of gray wastewater
  infrastructure. Through an adaptive management approach, the project reduces nutrient loads
  via agricultural and watershed best management practices—including cover crops, conservation
  cover, grassed waterways, wetland restoration, and structural erosion control measures—thereby
  avoiding the need for a tertiary/advanced filtration upgrade at the Nine Springs Wastewater
  Treatment Plant. Project Proponents quantify reduction in GHG emissions associated with the
  avoided energy and materials from the gray infrastructure that green solutions replace,
  including construction materials, decades of operational energy use, and facility maintenance.
  Credits issue annually ex-post throughout the avoided infrastructure's lifetime.
