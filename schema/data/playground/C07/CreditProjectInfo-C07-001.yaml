name: Woodburn
description: Woodburn is a beef breeding operation situated north of Walcha on the New England tablelands
  of Australia. The grasslands here grow on basalt and sandy loam soils and host Woodburn's
  high density herds of cattle. Considerable investments have been made at Woodburn to improve
  fencing and water infrastructure, enabling an increase in animal density integral to prescribed
  grazing. Continued improvement in the ecological state of the farm is core to how Woodburn is managed.
