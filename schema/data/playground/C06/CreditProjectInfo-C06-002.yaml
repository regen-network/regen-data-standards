name: Pimlico Farm
description: The primary indicator in this credit class is SOCS. Levels will be increased by growing harvestable and cover crops and grass to maximise canopy and root growth while incorporating crop residues and manures. Reduced soil disturbance, maintaining soil cover and returning crop residues will maximise retained organic matter (OM) in the soil and, through improved soil microbial activity, this will be converted to resilient SOC.
