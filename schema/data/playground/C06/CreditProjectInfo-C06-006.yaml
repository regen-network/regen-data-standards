name: Botany Farm Partnership
description: The project involves changes in farming methods to reverse soil degradation and water run-off, increase SOCS, improve soil and business resilience, and improve water quality. These changes are also being implemented to address increasing weed, pest and disease burdens and, over time, to reduce reliance on inorganic fertilisers and pesticides. Increases in SOCS are expected to improve soil workability, structure, drainage and water retention thereby reducing cultivation costs and improving crop yields.
