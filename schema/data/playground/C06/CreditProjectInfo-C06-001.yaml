description: This project aims to  achieve GHG removals through the implementation of Regenerative Farming practices to improve soil structure and  increase Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks. SOC levels will be increased by growing harvestable and cover crops and grass to maximise root growth, while incorporating crop residues and manures. Reduced soil disturbance and maintaining soil cover will ensure that this root growth is retained in the soil and, through improved soil microbial activity, converted to resilient SOC.
