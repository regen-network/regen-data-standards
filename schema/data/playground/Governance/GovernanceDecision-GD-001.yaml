  Agent recommendation on the C09 Soil Carbon credit class submission
  following review under WO-001.

decisionType: RECOMMEND
governanceLayer: LAYER_2_AGENTIC_OVERSIGHT
decidedBy: AGENT-001
subjectType: CreditClass
subjectId: C09
decision: CONDITIONAL
confidence: 0.78
rationale: >
  The C09 methodology demonstrates sound soil carbon measurement approaches
  but requires additional permanence period documentation and buffer pool
  specification before approval. Three evidence sources reviewed confirm
  methodology validity; however, the crediting period exceeds comparable
  programs without sufficient justification.
