name: Ruuts Credit Class for Soil Carbon Sequestration through Regenerative Grazing
description: >-
  The Credit Class and its accompanying methodology provide farmers with a
  measuring and monitoring process for soil organic carbon sequestration in
  regenerative grazing systems, enabling them to generate carbon credits that
  also include robust ecological co-benefits such as water infiltration and
  biodiversity.
