name: Credit Class for Sheep Grazing in Vineyard Systems
description:
  This Credit Class and its accompanying methodology are designed to support
  the use of high-density, short-duration rotational targeted sheep grazing in vineyard
  systems to improve ecosystem functioning through active management of the soil and
  herbaceous cover in the vineyard understory. As with other Environmental Stewardship
  methodologies, the environmental benefits are implicit in the practice. Projects
  being developed under the Methodology for Grazing in Vineyard Systems are expected,
  based on prior research, to result in positive ecological outcomes. This methodology
  is new and innovative, and will be improved as new projects are created and lessons
  are learned.
