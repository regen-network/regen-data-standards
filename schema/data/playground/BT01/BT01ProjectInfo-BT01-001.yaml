name: El Globo Habitat Bank
description: >
  El Globo is the first project in Colombia to issue Voluntary Biodiversity Credits. It is located
  in the "Cuchilla Jardín-Támesis" Integrated Management District (DMI). Known as the "water star"
  of southwestern Antioquia, this area is a prioritized ecosystem for conservation. Here ecosystem
  preservation, forest enhancement and restoration activities are implemented to generate positive
  and permanent impacts on biodiversity. The project has a 30-year financial, technical and legal
  structure for operation, securing biodiversity gains in time. The area has one of the few remnants
  of Native High Andean Forest still preserved in the region and it is a registered Habitat Bank
  at the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia.
