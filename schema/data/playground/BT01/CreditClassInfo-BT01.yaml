  The Biodioversity Credits protocol outlines a strategic framework for
  the development of projects that guarantee quantifiable gains in biodiversity, all
  while providing robust financial and legal assurances to secure their sustainability
  and enduring impact. This pioneering approach to biodiversity conservation and resource
  management emphasizes the selection of projects distinguished by their significant
  ecological value within a performance-based model.

  This protocol streamlines the process of registration, quantification, and issuance of Biodiversity Credits (VBC) for conservation projects that meet the eligibility criteria.
  It is designed to resonate with both individuals and organizations committed to
  contributing to the preservation of threatened ecosystems and biodiversity,
  ultimately delivering long-term sustainability and socio-economic benefits.
