name: SeaTrees Crediting Protocol for Marine Restoration
description:
  This protocol is designed to help local communities scale the restoration
  of degraded nearshore ecosystems and provide direct market access to philanthropic,
  donation-based funding via biodiversity credits called SeaTrees Biodiversity Blocks.
  It is a roadmap for designing effective marine restoration projects that can be
  funded via the insurance of voluntary biodiversity credits. This protocol also contains
  three ecosystem-specific modules, which provide guidelines and best-practices for
  restoring coral reefs, mangrove forests, and kelp forests. This protocol does not
  allow issuance of carbon credits or biodiversity offsets.
