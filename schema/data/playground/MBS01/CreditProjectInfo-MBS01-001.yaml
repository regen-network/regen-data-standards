name: Mangrove Forest - Marereni
description: This project empowers local communities to plant and protect mangrove ecosystems in Marereni, Kilifi County, Kenya. Through mangrove planting and restoration, the project aims to restore degraded coastal ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, sequester carbon, and provide livelihood opportunities for local communities. The project targets planting three mangrove species (Ceriops tagal, Avicennia marina, and Rhizophora mucronata) at a density of 10,000 trees per hectare across 500 hectares of coastal area.
