name: Harvey Manning Park Expansion
description: The 15.14 acre Harvey Manning Park Expansion project is part of 33 acres in the "Issaquah Alps" comprised of Tiger, Squak, and Cougar Mountains, above Lake Sammamish. Within Issaquah city limits and the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Area corridor, the 100+ year old forest includes riparian and wetland habitat that supports wildlife corridors on Cougar Mountain and protects cool freshwater streams that feed Tibbetts Creek, a salmon-bearing tributary to Lake Sammamish. The City of Issaquah worked with community, King County, and the Trust for Public Land to protect this site.
