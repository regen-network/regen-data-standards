The program, operated by TreeFolks, restores healthy forest buffers of local rivers and streams in eastern Travis County. TreeFolks planted more than 23,000 native trees on 31.47 acres of private owned parcels. Tree saplings were planted less than 10 feet on center in order to provide canopy coverage in these riparian zones.
