description: "Lookout Mountain is one of the most biologically diverse and critically imperiled ecoregions in the world stretching 90+ miles across three states; Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. The 58 acre oak-pine forest is situated between the Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park and the historic St. Elmo neighborhood. By protecting this property, the Conservancy ensures connectivity between habitat corridors and provides essential wildlife habitat for several species including eastern box turtles, red tailed hawks, black bears, and spotted salamanders."
