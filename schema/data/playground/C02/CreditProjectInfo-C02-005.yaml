name: "Evergreen & East Preservation Project"
description: "The 65-acre project area comprises two adjacent historic African American burial grounds founded in the 1890s in the East End of Richmond, VA. Together, the two cemeteries provide a resting place for over 25,000 individuals who contributed in important ways to the city’s – and the nation’s – vibrant social, political, intellectual, and religious life. After decades of neglect, volunteers began chipping away at recovering both cemeteries and created a plan to restore and protect the forested site."
