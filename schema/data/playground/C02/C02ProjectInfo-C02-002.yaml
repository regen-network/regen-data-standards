name: Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project
description: The Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project preserves a 132-acre forest on a 214-acre property, containing a diverse, 85-year forest with yellow poplar, sugar maple, oak, black cherry, and pin trees. Western Reserve Land Conservancy's forest conservation creates community benefits including carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and open space protection. Preservation of the large, diverse intact forest is increasingly rare in Richland County due to rapid agricultural development and continued threat of urban expansion from the adjacent Village of Lexington.
