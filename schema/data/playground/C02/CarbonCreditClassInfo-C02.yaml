description: >-
  City Forest Credits is the national standard for greenhouse gas emission
  reduction and removal for tree projects in cities and towns. Developed by
  leading scientists, industry, and urban forest professionals, the Standard
  and Protocols define the set of rules and requirements that tree preservation
  projects must follow in order to earn third-party verified carbon credits.

  CFC has a 40-year and a 100-year Tree Preservation Protocol, modeled after
  avoided conversion or avoided emissions protocols in forestry. The 40-year
  Protocol was designed for the voluntary market and the 100-year Protocol for
  the compliance market in the state of California.
