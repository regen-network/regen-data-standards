name: Reforesting Des Moines
description: A 26-year afforestation and reforestation project planting trees in Des Moines, Iowa. The project generates carbon credits through increased carbon sequestration while improving urban green infrastructure and community well-being. Tree planting locations were a mix of street tree and park plantings, with the major focus on street tree plantings. Growing Futures teen employees (ages 14-18) along with community volunteers completed the plantings and ongoing watering for each tree planted.
