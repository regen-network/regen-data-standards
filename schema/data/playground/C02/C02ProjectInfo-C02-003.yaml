name: Buena Vista Heights Conservation Area
description: Allegheny Land Trust protected 124 acres of woodlands from rapid encroaching residential development in Allegheny County. The 40 year old maple, cherry and oak-hickory forest provides habitat for deer, turkey, and birds, used by local hikers, birders, and mountain bikers. Located within the Youghiogheny River Watershed, this protected forest is five miles upstream from the Monongahela River, contributing to maintaining clean drinking water for the Pittsburgh region's residents. Revenue from carbon credits is put towards acquisition costs, land stewardship, and expansion of conservation lands.
