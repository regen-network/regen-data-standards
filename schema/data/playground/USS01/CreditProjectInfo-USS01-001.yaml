name: Jaguar Stewardship in the Pantanal Conservation Network
description: >
  The Instituto Homem Pantaneiro (IHP) is an NGO dedicated to preserving the Brazilian Pantanal biome,
  considered the largest continental wetland on the planet and a Natural World Heritage Site. IHP conducts
  a range of activities to improve ecosystem health and jaguar habitat, including: managing protected areas,
  firefighting, monitoring biodiversity and deforestation, conducting research, and facilitating dialogue
  among stakeholders. One credit represents a composite measure of biodiversity stewardship effectiveness,
  focused on jaguars as an umbrella species, across a 40,613-hectare private conservation reserve, based
  on a Theory of Change established by ERA and IHP. The project combines advanced monitoring technologies
  with community engagement to address key threats, particularly wildfires which affected over 90% of the
  Serra do Amolar region in 2020.
