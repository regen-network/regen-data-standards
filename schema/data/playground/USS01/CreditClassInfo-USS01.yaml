name: Biodiversity Credit Protocol for Umbrella Species Stewardship
description: >-
  The Biodiversity Crediting Protocol for Umbrella Species Stewardship
  (USS) provides a comprehensive framework for measuring, verifying, and rewarding
  communities for their conservation of umbrella species—organisms whose protection
  benefits entire ecosystems and their inhabitants. The protocol measures conservation
  success through three integrated components: Umbrella Species Health, which tracks
  population dynamics and distribution; Habitat Quality, which assesses ecosystem
  composition and function; and a Theory of Change, which translates community knowledge
  and long-term goals into strategic conservation activities. By combining on-the-ground
  data collection, remote sensing, and traditional ecological knowledge, the protocol
  enables scientifically rigorous and transparent verification of conservation outcomes.
  All ecological data anchors securely to a blockchain, ensuring credible, verifiable
  proof of impact. The USS credits represent actual implementation costs, directly
  linking conservation finance to real biodiversity gains while preventing speculative
  trading. This empowers local communities and land stewards to address critical biodiversity
  threats and strengthens their essential role in long-term ecosystem stewardship.
