name: "San Juan Carbon Project"
description: "The San Juan Islands Garry Oak Restoration Burns Project focuses on producing biochar from waste biomass in Washington's San Juan Islands. By converting wood waste gathered from wildfire prevention and invasive species control efforts into biochar, this project sequesters carbon, reduces GHG emissions, and restores native Garry Oak woodlands. The in-stand biochar application enhances soil health and supports long-term carbon storage."
