  "schema:description": "The Biodiversity Crediting Protocol for Umbrella Species Stewardship (USS) provides a comprehensive framework for measuring, verifying, and rewarding communities for their conservation of umbrella speciesâ€”organisms whose protection benefits entire ecosystems and their inhabitants. The protocol measures conservation success through three integrated components: Umbrella Species Health, which tracks population dynamics and distribution; Habitat Quality, which assesses ecosystem composition and function; and a Theory of Change, which translates community knowledge and long-term goals into strategic conservation activities. By combining on-the-ground data collection, remote sensing, and traditional ecological knowledge, the protocol enables scientifically rigorous and transparent verification of conservation outcomes. All ecological data anchors securely to a blockchain, ensuring credible, verifiable proof of impact. The USS credits represent actual implementation costs, directly linking conservation finance to real biodiversity gains while preventing speculative trading. This empowers local communities and land stewards to address critical biodiversity threats and strengthens their essential role in long-term ecosystem stewardship.",
