  "schema:description": "This protocol is designed to help local communities scale the restoration of degraded nearshore ecosystems and provide direct market access to philanthropic, donation-based funding via biodiversity credits called SeaTrees Biodiversity Blocks. It is a roadmap for designing effective marine restoration projects that can be funded via the insurance of voluntary biodiversity credits. This protocol also contains three ecosystem-specific modules, which provide guidelines and best-practices for restoring coral reefs, mangrove forests, and kelp forests. This protocol does not allow issuance of carbon credits or biodiversity offsets.",
