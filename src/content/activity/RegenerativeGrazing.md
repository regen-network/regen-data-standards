Regenerative grazing is an adaptive, principle-driven livestock management practice that focuses on improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and building climate resilience through planned grazing events. It serves as the broad umbrella under which best management practice (BMP) grazing techniques — including adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing, holistic planned grazing, rotational grazing, and mob grazing — are organized.

Rather than following a fixed protocol, regenerative grazing relies on continuous observation and adaptive decision-making to synchronize grazing intensity, timing, frequency, and duration with local environmental and climatic conditions. Core management principles include high stock densities with short grazing duration, extended rest and recovery periods for grazed paddocks, maintaining adequate residual biomass, and multi-species livestock integration.

Regenerative grazing aims to repair, rebuild, and restore ecosystem function by leveraging the natural relationship between grazing animals and grassland ecology. Documented outcomes include increased soil organic carbon sequestration, improved water infiltration and retention, greater plant species diversity, reduced dependence on external fertility inputs, and enhanced forage biomass production over time.
