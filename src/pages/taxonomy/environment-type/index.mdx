# Environment Type Taxonomy

The environment type taxonomy is a hierarchical classification of natural and managed landscape and seascape cover types. This taxonomy organizes and categorizes the diversity of landscapes where projects exist. The classification is designed to provide a mental image of the landscape where project activities occur. These should not be rigorously defined technical definitions that would be used to describe ecosystems or land cover/land use mapping classes.
