# Impact Taxonomy

The impact taxonomy categorizes and helps users understand a project or initiative's current and potential impact. Impacts are either measured or implicit. Measured impacts are based on data measured within the project area during the project period, while implicit impacts are based on well-established relationships between an activity and an outcome through peer-reviewed research or documented empirical evidence.
